# CRUD Application with Node.js, Express.js, and Firestore

This is a pure Backend project created to better understand the basics of API's and CRUD operations


## Description
This project is a robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application, built with Node.js and Express.js, 
enabling efficient data management through Firestore as the database. 

The application provides endpoints for handling various operations on user data, making it a versatile and scalable solution.


## Key Features:

• **Node.js and Express.js API**: The application is powered by a backend API developed using Node.js and Express.js. 
This allows for seamless handling of CRUD operations and provides a strong foundation for further expansion.

• **Firestore Database Integration**: Firestore, a NoSQL cloud-based database, is integrated into the application, providing a flexible and efficient data storage solution. It allows for easy scaling as the application's data needs grow.

• **CORS Middleware**: CORS middleware is implemented to enable cross-origin requests, allowing the frontend to interact securely with the backend API from different domains.

• **Retrieve, Add, Update, Delete Endpoints**: The API offers endpoints to fetch, add, update, and delete user data. This enables complete control over user information and supports the CRUD functionality.

# Usage:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install dependencies using npm install.
3. Set up your Firestore credentials and configurations.
4. Start the server using `npm start`
5. Access the API endpoints to perform CRUD operations on user data.
